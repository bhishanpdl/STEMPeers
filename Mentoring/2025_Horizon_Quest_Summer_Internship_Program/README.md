# How to Submit Homework

## Step 01: Get the homeworks and class materials in Box Drive
- https://www.dropbox.com/home/Bhishan%20Cohort/Classes
- STEMPEERS prefers Box Drive for the collaboration.
- All the class materials are shared here.
- All homeworks are posted here.
- All students have access to classes, but they have separate folders to upload thier homeworks.
- You can also view class materials at github: https://github.com/bhishanpdl/STEMPeers/tree/main/Mentoring/2025_Horizon_Quest_Summer_Internship_Program

## Step 02: Solve all homeworks in Google Colab
- [Google Colaboratory (Colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- You need to create your own google colab account.
- When done, please share the google colab with me: `bhishanpdl@gmail.com`.
- Please download the google colab notebook and upload in Box Drive.
- Once you share the colab link and upload in Box drive, then it will be graded.


## Step 03: Box Drive link to upload your homework
- In the folder `Homeworks`, there is folder of your name like `Firstname_Lastname`.
- For classes you all have access to the folder, but to submit homework, you have only access to your name folder.
- Each week you need to create folder like: `week_n` and put all your homeworks there.
