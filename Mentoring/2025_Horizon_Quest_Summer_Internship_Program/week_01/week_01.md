# 🌟 Week 1 Task: Getting Started with Python & Google Colab

Welcome to your first task in the **Horizons Quest Summer Internship Program - Introduction to AI and Machine Learning**! This week, we’ll lay the foundation for everything we’ll be doing in the weeks to come.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

- Understand and use basic Python syntax
- Write simple Python functions
- Use [Google Colaboratory (Colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/) to write and run Python code in the cloud
- Read a `.csv` file using basic file-handling techniques in Python

---

## 📝 Tasks

### 1. Learn the Basics of Python
Use any of the following beginner-friendly resources to get started:

- [Python for Beginners – W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)
- [Python Basics on Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming)
- [Google’s Python Class (Optional)](https://developers.google.com/edu/python)

Start with:
- Variables and data types
- `print()` statements
- `if` statements and `for` loops
- Defining your own functions

### 2. Get Familiar with Google Colab

Google Colab is a free online platform that lets you write and run Python code in your browser. You don’t need to install anything.

- Visit: [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- Log in with your Google account
- Create a new notebook
- Try writing a simple “Hello, World!” program

### 3. Write a Simple Python Function

In your Google Colab notebook, write a function of your choice. Here are some ideas:

- A function that returns the square of a number
- A function that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit
- A function that checks whether a number is even or odd

> Example:
```python
def square_number(n):
    return n * n
```



## 📅 Submission Instructions

* Create a new Google Colab notebook titled `Week1_Task_FirstnameLastname`
* Complete all four tasks above in that notebook
* Download the notebook and send the email
