# Updates:
Dear Students,

NOTE: No class this week, but final presentation next week

I have received some emails about the homework of titanic survival classification about more details about the project.
Requirements:
===============

1. Build multiple models ( logistic regression, decision tree and random forest) to find whether a passenger will survive or not based on the titanic data.
2. There is no hard requirements, you can feel free to be creative to build the models
3. You need to create README.md file with explanation what you did.
4. Also, You need to create powerpoint about the project
  + describe what the titanic data is
  + why you are doing this project (answer: STEMPPERS summer project
  + what methods you used to classify the passengers
  + how accurate is your model
  + what did you learn from the project

Once, you build the powerpoint, you will have options next week to present the presentation to STEMPEERS.
